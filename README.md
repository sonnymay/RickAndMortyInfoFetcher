# RickAndMortyInfoFetcher

RickAndMortyInfoFetcher is a simple Python project that uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) to fetch and display information about characters from the "Rick and Morty" series.

## Project Structure

The main functionality of the project is implemented in the `RickAndMorty` class, which is located in the main Python script.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/RickAndMortyInfoFetcher.git
```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```
python main.py
```

When prompted, enter the ID of the character you want to get information about. The script will then fetch the character's information from the Rick and Morty API and print it to the console.

To quit the script, enter 0 when asked for a character ID.

## Future Improvements

This project could be expanded in several ways:

1. Add methods to the `RickAndMorty` class to get information about episodes and locations.

2. Improve the user interface by creating a menu system or making it a web app.

3. Implement error handling for edge cases, such as when a character ID does not exist.
